# Polynomials, different polynomial bases  and demonstration of the same

This repository is for DA623: Computing with Signals course project. It contains code demonstrating the different polynomial bases with special attention to orthogonal bases

## Overview

In this notebook, we'll explore the concept of polynomials and different polynomial bases. Specifically, we will be looking at Vandermonde, Legendre and Chebyshev bases.
